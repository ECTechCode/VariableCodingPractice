"""
For each constant declaration in the code, evaluate the naming 
convention used and determine if it follows the recommended practice. 
Explain your reasoning for each constant. Additionally, identify the incorrect 
reassignment and provide a comment explaining why it is incorrect. Finally, predict the 
output of each print statement.
